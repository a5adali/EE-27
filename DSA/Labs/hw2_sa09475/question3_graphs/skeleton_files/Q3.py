        Retrieves the list of edges incident to a given warehouse in the supply chain graph.

        An incident edge is an edge that has the given warehouse as either its source or destination.

        Parameters:
        G (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency map.
        wh (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID for which incident edges are being retrieved.

        Returns:
        list: A list of tuples representing incident edges in the format:
            (origin_warehouse, destination_warehouse, shipment_time, shipment_cost, shipping_method).
            If no incident edges exist, the function returns an empty list.

        Checks if there is a direct connection between two warehouses in the supply chain graph.

        This function determines whether an outbound shipment exists from the origin warehouse to 
        the destination warehouse. Remember, a shipment cannot originate and end at the same warehouse, 
        so that connection will be considered False

        Parameters:
        graph (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency map.
        warehouse_o (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the origin vertex.
        warehouse_i (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the destination vertex.

        Returns:
        bool: True if there is a direct connection from warehouse_o to warehouse_i, False otherwise.

        Example:
        >>> is_connected(G, "W1", "W11")
            (Warehouse, W1 has an outgoing connection to W11)
            True

        Finds the fastest alternate shipping route between two warehouses even if the direct connection is available.

        This function first checks if there is a direct connection between the origin and destination warehouse.
        If the direct connection exists, it finds an alternative route using the same shipping method but 
        with the shortest shipment time.

        Parameters:
        graph (dict): The supply chain graph represented as an adjacency map.
        warehouse_o (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the origin vertex.
        warehouse_i (str): The alphanumeric warehouse ID of the destination vertex.

        Returns:
        tuple: A list of tuples representing the fastest alternate edge in the format:
            (origin_warehouse, destination_warehouse, shipment_time, shipment_cost, shipping_method).
            Returns None if either of the origin or destination warehouses do not exist.
            Returns -1 if no alternate edge exists.

            (Shipment Method between W15 and W5 is via Sea, so if we remove this connection, the next faster Sea shipment
